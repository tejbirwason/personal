**`Amnesia`**` is a deficit in `[`memory`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory)` caused by `[`brain damage`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage)` or disease,`[`[1]`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia#cite_note-Gazzaniga-1)` but it can also be caused temporarily by the use of various `[`sedatives`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative)` and `[`hypnotic`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotic)` `[`drugs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug)`. The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused.`[`[2]`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia#cite_note-2)

Too many of our daily choices and decisions are path-dependent on the past. There might be a valid case for self-induced amnesia, where you try to forget about the past day (and all past misfortunes) that hold one back.

Complete loss of memory would be unproductive as you still want to learn from your past. Hence, a delicate balance between memory loss and being easy on yourself to look at the past objectively is key to developing healthy amnesia.

I have noticed that there are some days when I wake up, maybe it is because I had a good night's sleep or had a good workout the previous day, I have a sort of clarity and focus on the present that is absent on other days. Wonder if this type of amnesia can be cultivated consciously rather than being dependant on the night before.
