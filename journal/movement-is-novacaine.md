title: Movement is novacaine
excerpt: Keep trucking

I've noticed that days I move or walk a lot, the night's sleep is more restful, and all background anxiety just fades away.

My sedentary day job glues me to the screen for 6-7 hours per day. If I were to cut out distractions, I could cut that number in half, restricting screen time to only high-output activities. All moving time could still be consumptive, by listening to podcasts and audiobooks.

Like most of us, I only have a beginner's understanding of the evolutionary reasons why we are wired to be moving all day long. Descending from nomadic tribes, wandering year-long to get to the next spot with food or shelter, I understand the theory. But in today's modern age, what are the best ways to tap that wiring, and what is the minimum necessary dose, is still an open question.

I've added `Move Your DNA` book to my bookshelf to learn more. More to come on this as my thinking evolves.
