excerpt: System setting for the blog, very meta

---
I've attempted and failed at creating a daily routine for a blog for quite a while now.

Finally, I believe I have cracked it, this blog will be used to:

1. Share something I learned that day
2. Act as a personal wiki into the journey of learning complex topics
3. Develop a strong and consistent daily writing habit

Typically, I will write this blog at the end of each workday so I expect it to be fairly tech-heavy.
