excerpt: And what comes after it

I was just reading the ARK Big Ideas paper for 2021 that led me down the path to learning more about reinforcement learning in AI.

Surprisingly to me, the compute resources required for reinforcement learning are 10x those for language understanding (Alexa, Siri).

Reinforcement learning is a lot like this Fatboy Slim video, a course correction in the endless march to somewhere (or nowhere?):

If AI is on a path to transcend human consciousness, reinforcement learning get's AI to recreate what humans consciously already do, which is evolving through pure trial and error. Is this the end of progress in AI?

In other words, will true progress in AI only happen through a breakthrough in a tangential field that discovers what comes after reinforcement learning? 

What is the next 10x step up from reinforcement learning? Strap in, it will be a hell of a decade.
