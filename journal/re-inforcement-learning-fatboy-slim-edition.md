excerpt: And what comes after it

While reading the ARK's 2021 Big Ideas paper I've been in a rabbit hole of reinforcement learning in AI.

The compute resources required for reinforcement learning are 10x those for language understanding (Alexa, Siri). This got me wondering where will the next 10x come from?

Reinforcement learning is a lot like this Fatboy Slim video, a course correction in the endless march to somewhere (or nowhere?):

If AI is on a path to transcend human consciousness, reinforcement learning recreates what humans already consciously do, evolving through pure trial and error. Is this the end of progress in AI?

In other words, will the next step function in AI only happen through a breakthrough in a tangential field that reveals what comes after reinforcement learning?

What is the next 10x step up from reinforcement learning? Strap in, it will be a hell of a decade.
